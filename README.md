<h1> Pari os </h1>

In this project I am simply trying to built an architecture to understand the overall computer system.
I was exploring option to write operating system where C is a pretty much a first option that pop up in my head.
with c you need a little bit of hack with assembly langauge so tried some code based on intel x86_64 (long mode)
but encountered some series issue learning curve there is not so easy. then one day came accross RUST and now in a week
I am ready with my first bare metal hello world.
Its just for educational purpose so dont know where I will go with this, but I will continue with this project. Any review or suggestion is much appreciated.
